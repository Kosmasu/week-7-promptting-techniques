    I want you to analyze emails for phishing attempts. Here are some examples of how to analyze them:

    EXAMPLE 1:
    Email: "Dear Customer, Your account will be suspended. Click here to verify: http://amaz0n-secure.tk"
    Analysis:
    - Phishing Verdict: Yes
    - Risk Score: 8/10
    - Identified Tactics: Urgency creation, impersonation, suspicious URL (TLD .tk)
    - Technical Indicators: Non-corporate domain, URL mismatch, generic greeting
    - Recommended Actions: Delete email, report to security team, do not click links

    EXAMPLE 2:
    Email: "Hi John, Attached is the Q3 budget report we discussed yesterday. Let me know if you need any clarification. Regards, Sarah - Finance Department"
    Analysis:
    - Phishing Verdict: No
    - Risk Score: 2/10
    - Identified Tactics: None identified
    - Technical Indicators: No suspicious links, expected attachment, personalized context, sender matches expected communication pattern
    - Recommended Actions: Normal processing, verify sender if attachment seems unusual

    Now analyze this email:
    "Meeting Confirmation: Project Kickoff - March 5, 2:00 PM EST
        Hi Team, Please confirm your attendance for the project kickoff meeting.
        Agenda and dial-in details attached. Best, Michael Chen"

## Phishing Analysis:

**Phishing Verdict:** No

**Risk Score:** 3/10

**Identified Tactics:** 
- Urgency creation: Meeting confirmation with implied time sensitivity.

**Technical Indicators:**
- Familiar sender: Email originates from a recognized internal address.
- Corporate domain: Uses a legitimate domain name associated with the company.
- Consistent formatting: Email layout and grammar suggest internal communication style.
- Attached agenda: Common practice for meetings.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Proceed with caution, but no immediate action required.
- Verify the meeting details with a trusted colleague or the official company calendar.
- Be wary of urgent requests or attachments from unfamiliar sources.

**Additional Notes:**

- While the email lacks suspicious links or domain names, the sense of urgency created by the implied deadline could still be leveraged for phishing attacks.
- Employees should be trained to critically assess emails, regardless of the sender or content.
