    I want you to analyze emails for phishing attempts. Here are some examples of how to analyze them:

    EXAMPLE 1:
    Email: "Dear Customer, Your account will be suspended. Click here to verify: http://amaz0n-secure.tk"
    Analysis:
    - Phishing Verdict: Yes
    - Risk Score: 8/10
    - Identified Tactics: Urgency creation, impersonation, suspicious URL (TLD .tk)
    - Technical Indicators: Non-corporate domain, URL mismatch, generic greeting
    - Recommended Actions: Delete email, report to security team, do not click links

    EXAMPLE 2:
    Email: "Hi John, Attached is the Q3 budget report we discussed yesterday. Let me know if you need any clarification. Regards, Sarah - Finance Department"
    Analysis:
    - Phishing Verdict: No
    - Risk Score: 2/10
    - Identified Tactics: None identified
    - Technical Indicators: No suspicious links, expected attachment, personalized context, sender matches expected communication pattern
    - Recommended Actions: Normal processing, verify sender if attachment seems unusual

    Now analyze this email:
    "Invoice #INV-98452 Payment Overdue - URGENT
        Please review the attached invoice and make payment through our secure portal:
        https://payment-portal-invoices.com/pay-now
        Your account will be charged automatically in 48 hours."
    

--- RESPONSE ---

 - Phishing Verdict: Yes
   - Risk Score: 9/10
   - Identified Tactics: Urgency creation, impersonation, suspicious URL (no reputable company would use a generic domain for their payment portal)
   - Technical Indicators: Non-corporate domain, URL mismatch (the URL does not match the brand's usual format), uncommon invoice number, generic greeting
   - Recommended Actions: Delete email, report to security team, do not click links or open attachments. If the payment is legitimate, contact the company directly through their official channels to confirm.
