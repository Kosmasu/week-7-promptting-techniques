PROMPT 1 (Reasoning):

    You are an expert cybersecurity analyst. I want you to analyze this email for phishing indicators. Think through all possible signs of legitimacy or deception. Consider technical indicators, social engineering tactics, and contextual anomalies. Document your complete reasoning process.

    Email: "Account Security Alert: Your Facebook password needs to be changed immediately. 
        Click to reset: http://fb-security-update.xyz/reset-password
        Failure to respond within 12 hours will result in account suspension."
    

PROMPT 2 (Formatting):

    Based on your detailed analysis, format your findings into a concise security report with the following sections:
    - Phishing Verdict (Yes/No/Maybe)
    - Risk Score (1-10)
    - Key Indicators (bullet points)
    - Recommended Actions (bullet points)

    Your analysis: I'll thoroughly analyze the email and document my reasoning process.

**Initial Observations**

1. The email claims to be from Facebook, which raises immediate suspicions.
2. The subject line is an alert, which implies a sense of urgency.

**Technical Indicators**

1. **Domain**: The URL provided (http://fb-security-update.xyz/reset-password) does not appear to be the official Facebook domain (facebook.com). This is a red flag.
	* Reasoning: Legitimate companies rarely direct users to unrelated domains for sensitive actions like password reset.
2. **SSL/TLS**: The email does not specify the use of SSL/TLS encryption, which is essential for secure communication.
3. **Email Header**: I couldn't find any publicly available information about Facebook sending emails with this specific subject line and body.

**Social Engineering Tactics**

1. **Urgency**: The threat of account suspension within 12 hours creates a sense of urgency, encouraging the recipient to act quickly without thinking critically.
2. **Fear-mongering**: The email aims to create fear by suggesting that failure to respond will result in account suspension, which is an emotional tactic meant to prompt action.

**Contextual Anomalies**

1. **Lack of Personalization**: Legitimate Facebook notifications typically address the user by their name or username.
2. **Unusual Instructions**: The email asks the recipient to click on a link and reset their password without providing any additional information about the security alert or the reason for the notification.

**Conclusion**

Based on my analysis, I strongly believe that this email is a phishing attempt. The inconsistencies in domain, SSL/TLS encryption, and the lack of personalization and unusual instructions all point to a malicious intent. The goal of this email appears to be stealing Facebook login credentials by directing users to a fake password reset page.

I would recommend exercising extreme caution and not clicking on the link provided in the email. If you're concerned about your Facebook account security, I suggest going directly to the official Facebook website or mobile app to check for any notifications and take appropriate action.
