PROMPT 3 (Integration):

    Based on the following technical and social engineering analyses, provide a unified phishing risk assessment:

    Technical Analysis:  Based on the provided email, here are some technical indicators of phishing that should be considered:

1. Sender address analysis: The sender's email address is not clearly visible in the given information. A legitimate email from Facebook would usually come from a verified and recognizable email address associated with Facebook (e.g., [name@facebookmail.com]). The absence of such an identifier raises suspicions.

2. URL/domain inspection: The link provided ("http://fb-security-update.xyz/reset-password") is not a standard or official Facebook domain. Facebook's legitimate domains include facebook.com, m.facebook.com, and fbcdn.net, among others. The use of an unfamiliar domain like "fb-security-update.xyz" is a red flag.

3. Attachment analysis: No attachments are visible in the email provided. However, be wary of any unexpected or unsolicited emails containing attachments as they may contain malware.

4. Header anomalies: A thorough analysis would also include examining the email headers to verify the actual sender's IP address, mail server, and other technical information. This process can help identify whether the message was sent from a spoofed or compromised account.

5. Any technical deception methods: The email employs emotional manipulation by creating a sense of urgency (e.g., "Failure to respond within 12 hours will result in account suspension"). This tactic is often used in phishing attacks to prompt the recipient into acting impulsively without thoroughly examining the message. Additionally, the email claims to be about account security but does not verify the user's identity or provide specific information about the account that only the user would know.

In conclusion, based on these technical indicators, it is highly likely that this email is a phishing attempt. Users should not click on the link provided and should report the email to their email service provider and Facebook as spam.
    
    Social Engineering Analysis:  In the given email, several social engineering tactics can be identified:

1. Urgency/pressure tactics: The sender claims that immediate action is required to change the Facebook password. This creates a sense of urgency and forces the recipient to act quickly without thoroughly verifying the authenticity of the message. Also, the threat of account suspension within 12 hours if the email is not responded to adds pressure.

2. Authority impersonation: The sender claims to be from Facebook's security team, implying authority and trustworthiness. However, this can easily be a fake representation as it is common for cybercriminals to masquerade as officials or representatives of well-known organizations.

3. Emotional manipulation: While the email doesn't explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions, the potential loss of access to a Facebook account (often associated with personal and professional connections) could cause anxiety in some recipients. This can make them more likely to act impulsively and potentially fall for the phishing attempt.

4. Unusual requests: Asking users to reset their passwords via an external link instead of directing them to log into Facebook and manage their account is out of the ordinary and should raise suspicion. Additionally, clicking on the provided link would lead to a domain that does not match Facebook's official website (fb-security-update.xyz versus facebook.com).

5. Linguistic red flags: The email lacks personalization, addressing the recipient as "Dear User" instead of using their actual name. Additionally, it contains typos and poor grammar that are not common in official communications from well-established companies like Facebook.

    - Final phishing verdict
    - Risk score (1-10)
    - Recommended actions

RESPONSE 3 (Integration):
 Based on both the technical and social engineering analyses provided, it is highly likely that this email is a phishing attempt. The risk score for this email would be 9 out of 10, indicating a very high risk. Here are the recommended actions:

- Users should not click on the link provided and avoid downloading any attachments, if there were any, as they may contain malware.
- Recipients should report the email to their email service provider and Facebook as spam.
- If users are unsure or concerned about their account's security, they should log in to Facebook directly through the official website (facebook.com) instead of clicking on any links provided in suspicious emails.
- Users can also enable two-factor authentication for an added layer of security. This would require a second form of verification when logging into their accounts, making it more difficult for cybercriminals to gain access.
- Lastly, staying vigilant and educating oneself about the latest phishing tactics can help reduce the risk of falling victim to such attempts in the future.
