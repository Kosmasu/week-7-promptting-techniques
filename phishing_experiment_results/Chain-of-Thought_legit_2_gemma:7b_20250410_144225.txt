    As a cybersecurity expert, analyze the following email for phishing indicators. Think step by step:

    1. First, examine the sender address and compare it to the claimed identity
    2. Next, identify any urgency/pressure tactics or emotional manipulation
    3. Analyze all URLs by checking domain names and paths
    4. Look for grammatical errors, unusual phrasing, or inconsistencies
    5. Assess if the request in the email is typical or suspicious
    6. Consider the appropriate technical response
    7. Calculate an overall risk score

**Step 5: Request Analysis:**

- Lack of additional context or suspicious requests raise suspicion.


**Step 6: Technical Response:**

- Implement email filters to block emails from suspicious domains.
- Train employees to be aware of phishing attempts and verify sender identity.
