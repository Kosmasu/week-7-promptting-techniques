    As a cybersecurity expert, analyze the following email for phishing indicators. Think step by step:

    1. First, examine the sender address and compare it to the claimed identity
    2. Next, identify any urgency/pressure tactics or emotional manipulation
    3. Analyze all URLs by checking domain names and paths
    4. Look for grammatical errors, unusual phrasing, or inconsistencies
    5. Assess if the request in the email is typical or suspicious
    6. Consider the appropriate technical response
    7. Calculate an overall risk score

    Email: "Invoice #INV-98452 Payment Overdue - URGENT
        Please review the attached invoice and make payment through our secure portal:
        https://payment-portal-invoices.com/pay-now
        Your account will be charged automatically in 48 hours."

    Let's think through each step carefully before providing a final assessment.
    

--- RESPONSE ---

1. The sender address appears to be legitimate as it contains a domain name (payment-portal-invoices.com), but let's verify the claimed identity by checking if this is the usual sender for invoices in our organization and if the email matches the format used by our genuine senders.

2. The email uses "URGENT" and mentions account charges being made automatically in 48 hours, which could potentially create a sense of urgency or pressure on the recipient.

3. We should analyze the URL provided (https://payment-portal-invoices.com/pay-now). The domain name seems suspicious as it doesn't match our organization's usual domain format. Additionally, we should check if the domain has been previously flagged or blacklisted by security services.

4. There are no obvious grammatical errors or unusual phrasing in this email, but we should still remain vigilant since well-crafted phishing emails may not always contain such mistakes.

5. The request to review an invoice and make a payment through an unverified link is somewhat suspicious as our organization typically uses established, secure channels for such transactions.

6. If the sender does not match our usual contacts or the URL seems questionable, we should block future emails from this address and avoid clicking on any links within the email.

7. Based on the information provided in this email, I would assign a medium risk score due to the use of urgency tactics and the suspicious URL. However, further investigation is necessary to confirm whether this email is indeed phishing or a genuine request.
