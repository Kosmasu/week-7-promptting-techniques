PROMPT 1 (Reasoning):

    You are an expert cybersecurity analyst. I want you to analyze this email for phishing indicators. Think through all possible signs of legitimacy or deception. Consider technical indicators, social engineering tactics, and contextual anomalies. Document your complete reasoning process.

    Email: "Account Security Alert: Your Facebook password needs to be changed immediately. 
        Click to reset: http://fb-security-update.xyz/reset-password
        Failure to respond within 12 hours will result in account suspension."
    

PROMPT 2 (Formatting):

    Based on your detailed analysis, format your findings into a concise security report with the following sections:
    - Phishing Verdict (Yes/No/Maybe)
    - Risk Score (1-10)
    - Key Indicators (bullet points)
    - Recommended Actions (bullet points)

    Your analysis:  To analyze the given email for phishing indicators, I'll examine technical indicators, social engineering tactics, and contextual anomalies as requested.

1. Technical Indicators:
   - Link Hover Test: Hovering over the link does not reveal the actual URL (it should show in the lower left corner of most browsers). In this case, the URL is 'http://fb-security-update.xyz/reset-password'. It's unusual for Facebook to have a URL that isn't an official subdomain (e.g., facebook.com).
   - Email Address: The email doesn't come from a known and verified email address like support@facebook.com or noreply@facebook.com. Legitimate emails should come from these addresses to confirm their authenticity.
   - SSL Certificate: A legitimate link would have an SSL certificate to secure the connection, but that can be easily faked. However, it's essential to check for the padlock icon next to the URL in the browser.

2. Social Engineering Tactics:
   - Urgent Call-to-Action: The email contains a time-sensitive request (within 12 hours) to create urgency and pressure users into clicking the link without careful consideration. Facebook would usually send such notifications at a less critical time.
   - Lack of Personalization: The email doesn't address the user personally, using their name instead of "Dear [User Name]". Legitimate emails from Facebook would typically use personalization to increase trust and authenticity.

3. Contextual Anomalies:
   - Account Suspension Threat: This type of threat is out of character for Facebook as they prioritize user experience and rarely threaten immediate account suspension in email notifications without clear evidence of policy violations.

In conclusion, based on the analysis of technical indicators, social engineering tactics, and contextual anomalies, this email appears to be a phishing attempt. Users should not click on the link provided or provide any sensitive information. Instead, they can log in directly to their Facebook account to check for any pending security updates if needed.
