 Phishing Verdict: Maybe

   Risk Score: 3 (Low)

   Identified Tactics: Social Engineering (Email Phishing)

   Technical Indicators:
      1. Sender email address: The Daily Tech Digest <[newsletter@dailydigest.com](mailto:newsletter@dailydigest.com)> appears to be a legitimate sender, but it's not always a guarantee as attackers can spoof addresses.
      2. Links (if any): The email does not contain any clickable links, which makes it harder for the user to accidentally trigger a malicious action. However, the absence of clickable links doesn't necessarily mean that the email is safe.
      3. Attachments: None found in this email.

   Recommended Actions:
      1. Verify the subscription and sender by logging into your account directly at The Daily Tech Digest official website instead of clicking any links provided in the email.
      2. Be cautious when dealing with unsolicited emails, even if they seem legitimate. Legitimate organizations usually have clear identification and will never ask for sensitive information via email.
      3. Implement a spam filter or an email security solution to help reduce phishing attempts.
      4. Encourage users to report suspected phishing emails to the IT department immediately.
