    I want you to analyze emails for phishing attempts. Here are some examples of how to analyze them:

    EXAMPLE 1:
    Email: "Dear Customer, Your account will be suspended. Click here to verify: http://amaz0n-secure.tk"
    Analysis:
    - Phishing Verdict: Yes
    - Risk Score: 8/10
    - Identified Tactics: Urgency creation, impersonation, suspicious URL (TLD .tk)
    - Technical Indicators: Non-corporate domain, URL mismatch, generic greeting
    - Recommended Actions: Delete email, report to security team, do not click links

    EXAMPLE 2:
    Email: "Hi John, Attached is the Q3 budget report we discussed yesterday. Let me know if you need any clarification. Regards, Sarah - Finance Department"
    Analysis:
    - Phishing Verdict: No
    - Risk Score: 2/10
    - Identified Tactics: None identified
    - Technical Indicators: No suspicious links, expected attachment, personalized context, sender matches expected communication pattern
    - Recommended Actions: Normal processing, verify sender if attachment seems unusual

    Now analyze this email:
    "Account Security Alert: Your Facebook password needs to be changed immediately. 
        Click to reset: http://fb-security-update.xyz/reset-password
        Failure to respond within 12 hours will result in account suspension."

## Phishing Analysis:

**Phishing Verdict:** Yes

**Risk Score:** 7/10

**Identified Tactics:**

* **Urgency creation:** Threat of immediate account suspension within 12 hours.
* **Impersonation:** Uses the legitimate Facebook brand and logo, but with a suspicious domain (.xyz).
* **Social engineering:** Creates a sense of urgency and vulnerability to manipulate users.

**Technical Indicators:**

* Non-official Facebook domain.
* Mismatch between sender and domain name.
* Generic greeting instead of the user's name.
* Suspicious link with a generic reset password page.

**Recommended Actions:**

* Do not click the link.

* Change your Facebook password immediately using the official Facebook website or app.

**Additional Observations:**

* The email uses scare tactics and plays on the user's fear of account suspension.
* The sense of urgency is heightened with the deadline of 12 hours.
* The use of a non-official domain raises immediate suspicion.
