    I want you to analyze emails for phishing attempts. Here are some examples of how to analyze them:

    EXAMPLE 1:
    Email: "Dear Customer, Your account will be suspended. Click here to verify: http://amaz0n-secure.tk"
    Analysis:
    - Phishing Verdict: Yes
    - Risk Score: 8/10
    - Identified Tactics: Urgency creation, impersonation, suspicious URL (TLD .tk)
    - Technical Indicators: Non-corporate domain, URL mismatch, generic greeting
    - Recommended Actions: Delete email, report to security team, do not click links

    EXAMPLE 2:
    Email: "Hi John, Attached is the Q3 budget report we discussed yesterday. Let me know if you need any clarification. Regards, Sarah - Finance Department"
    Analysis:
    - Phishing Verdict: No
    - Risk Score: 2/10
    - Identified Tactics: None identified
    - Technical Indicators: No suspicious links, expected attachment, personalized context, sender matches expected communication pattern
    - Recommended Actions: Normal processing, verify sender if attachment seems unusual

    Now analyze this email:
    "Invoice #INV-98452 Payment Overdue - URGENT
        Please review the attached invoice and make payment through our secure portal:
        https://payment-portal-invoices.com/pay-now
        Your account will be charged automatically in 48 hours."
    

--- RESPONSE ---

Based on my analysis, I conclude that this email is likely a phishing attempt. Here's my detailed assessment:

**Phishing Verdict:** Yes
**Risk Score:** 9/10
**Identified Tactics:**

1. **Urgency creation**: The email creates a sense of urgency by stating that the account will be charged automatically in 48 hours, which is intended to prompt the recipient into taking action without thinking twice.
2. **Suspicious URL**: The payment portal URL provided (https://payment-portal-invoices.com/pay-now) appears to be a generic and untrusted domain, which may not be associated with your actual invoicing or financial services provider.
3. **Impersonation**: The email's tone and content attempt to impersonate an official invoice notification from your organization.

**Technical Indicators:**

1. **Non-corporate domain**: The URL provided does not match the expected domain for your organization's invoicing system, which could be a sign of a phishing attempt.
2. **Generic greeting**: The email lacks personalization, which is unusual for official invoice notifications from your company.

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Delete the email**: Do not engage with the email or click on any links, as they may lead to malware or phishing pages.
2. **Report to security team**: Inform your organization's security team about this potential phishing attempt to help them detect and prevent similar incidents in the future.

Remember, always exercise caution when receiving unsolicited emails, especially those containing urgent requests for payment or personal information. Verify the authenticity of the email and its contents before taking any action.
